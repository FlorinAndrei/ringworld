# ringworld
This is [Larry Niven's Ringworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworld), rendered to scale in 3D. The ray tracer used for this project is [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/).

According to the book, the Ringworld's radius is pretty close to the radius of Earth's orbit. The width of the ring band is 1.6 million kilometers (a little wider than the diameter of the Sun).

The star rendered in these images has the same diameter as our Sun, which is similar to the star described in the book.

The [ringworld.pov](/ringworld.pov) file shows the Ringworld seen from the orbit of Mars, just a little higher than the ecliptic plane. Open the image in a new tab to see it in full resolution.

The [floating.pov](/floating.pov) file shows a view from the Ringworld, while floating about 14 km above the surface - or think of it as a view from the top of a very tall mountain, almost twice as tall as Mount Everest.

I am not simulating (yet) the shadow squares.

Hopefully I'll add more views later.
